              <p className='m-4'>If you’d like to learn more about this type of energy healing, I recommend visiting the
              <a href='https://discoverhealing.com/' className='font-semibold text-[#00472d]'> Discover Healing Website</a>—it’s a fantastic resource with helpful videos and information. You’ll also find me
              listed there as a registered practitioner.</p>

              <p className='m-4'>All of my sessions are held remotely via Zoom and cost £55 for a one-hour session. The first session tends
              to run a little longer to allow us to go deeper, but there’s no extra charge.</p>

              <p className='m-4'>I currently offer appointments on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. My working days are Tuesdays and Wednesdays
                  with email monitoring on Monday’s afternoons and Thursday morning.</p>
